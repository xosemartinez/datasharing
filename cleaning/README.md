## Description of the code in run_analysis.R

1. Load the data 

   + The activities from  the __y__ files 

   + The number of subjects from the __subject__ files 

   + The data from the __x__ files

   + The names of the variables from the __features__ file

2. Merge the train and the test data

   + In the data frame __union__

3. Extract the variables with mean() and sd() values

4. Put comprensible names in the variables

5. Extract the averages for each subject and for each activity

## Code book

The variables in the database are values of time and frequency coming from 30 individuals conducting  a range of exercises.
